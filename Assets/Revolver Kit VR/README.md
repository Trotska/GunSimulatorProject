## Quickstart

1. Import SteamVR - [Steam VR Plugin](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/32647)
2. Make sure `Virtual Reality Supported` and `OpenVR` are selected in your Project Build Settings.
3. Open `Revolver Kit VR/Demo/Scenes` to find the demo scenes.

For OpenVR Rift support please import

1. [Oculus Platform SDK](https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/package/oculus-platform-sdk/)
2. [Oculus Utilities for Unity](https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/package/oculus-utilities-for-unity-5/)
3. [Oculus Avatar SDK](https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/package/oculus-avatar-sdk/)

NOTE: 
Revolver Kit VR currently requires the Steam VR Plugin for VR interactions.  In future version Occulus Utilities and VRTK Kit will be supported as well.


## Customization
You can customize how each Revolver is handled and how it acts.

Take a look at the `SV Controller Input` component to customize how the controller interacts with your Vive or Rift controllers.

Take a look at the `SV Revolver` component to customize things like muzzle velocity, the firing sounds, and how many bullets the revolver can fire without reloading.
